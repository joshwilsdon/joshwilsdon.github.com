This is my 9th post since [I started in on this](/2010/01/04/first-post) blogging thing.  Since I haven't missed any weeks so far in the challenge, my front page was starting to get cluttered.  Since [Kevin](http://yinkei.com) has managed to miss 4 weeks already, I even got free lunch today!

In order to make the front page a little less cluttered, I've moved older posts to the [new archive page.](/archive)  The 5 most recent posts will still be on this front page, but older posts will be available in the archive.  I've also added a link on the menu to the [scoreboard](/scoreboard) page.  That will help you keep track of how I'm doing in comparison to [Kevin](http://yinkei.com) and [Howie](http://howiewu.com).

Other things I'm thinking about changing sometime in the not too distant future include:

 * make the scoreboard auto-updating (I'm currently updating it manually)
 * add project pages/sections for some of my ongoing projects (with pics/code)
 * add an about page saying something about me
 * comments (I tried to make this work already, but [intense debate](http://intensedebate.com) was way too slow)
 * add more awesome

So keep checking back.

If you have any feedback let me know!  Just email <josh@wilsdon.ca>.
