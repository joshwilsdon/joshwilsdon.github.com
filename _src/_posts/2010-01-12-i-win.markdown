summary: Wherein I discuss how I already beat Kevin

It seems [Kevin](http://yinkei.com) challenged me and then proceeded to fall down on the job.  He never posted anything and it's well past the first week.  Oh well, I've got to keep going now or [Howie](http://www.howardwu.com) will beat me, and we can't have that.

With that out of the way, what sort of stuff will I be writing about in the future?  Good question.  Some of the ideas I've got so far include:

 * Electronics (I'm trying to teach myself to build robots)
 * Computers (I spend a lot of time with them)
 * Books (I love to read books)
 * Building, breaking and fixing stuff
 * Go (the game - though I've not played for a long time)
 * My dog (because the rest of my family won't let me write about them)
 * Other random stuff

We'll see how it goes.  It'll be an adventure!
