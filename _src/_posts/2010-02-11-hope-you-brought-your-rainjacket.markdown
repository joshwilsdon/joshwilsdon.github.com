summary: It's rainy in Vancouver

So...  I've been really really busy with work.  We're building the awesome.  In the meantime, everyone is coming to Vancouver.  Yesterday I saw some of team Sweden walking in front of my office window.  They looked lost and confused.  I hope they found the pub or whatever they were looking for.

Anyway, if you're coming to Vancouver, my suggestion is to bring a rain jacket.  I imagine a lot of people out there are planning to bring earmuffs, parkas and mittens because they're thinking 'Winter Olympics' = 'cold'.  Well, that's not going to help you here.  All you're going to end up with is wet mittens.  The thing some people don't realize is that not all of Canada is cold.  I've lived in cold parts of Canada.  This is not it, it's the wet part.  If you don't believe me, [go read about it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Vancouver#Precipitation)  If you got to Whistler, it might get a little bit colder.  I'm talking about Vancouver.

That's about all I have to say for now.  Oh, except don't bring an umbrella.  I really don't like umbrellas.  There's no room for them and they just end up getting in the way!  Especially when the streets are packed with people.  Instead bring a rain jacket.

P.S. It seems as though Kevin's [now failed twice](/scoreboard) since he [promised us free lunch for a week](http://yinkei.com/2010/01/the-start-of-a-new-year).  Does that mean 2 weeks of free lunch?
