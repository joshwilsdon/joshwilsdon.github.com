It's been a really long time since I've posted now and even longer since I posted regularly.  I [won the challenge](/scoreboard) for 2010, but that didn't continue into 2011.  Even if it had I'd still be ahead of [Kevin](http://yinkei.com) and -- with this post -- tied with [Howie](http://howiewu.com/).  Kevin's last post is almost 1 year ago and Howie's only posted two so far this year too.

I've been really busy this year in the first two quarters.  Working hard on some awesome new stuff at [Joyent](http://www.joyent.com) has left me with little time for other things.  I have realized though that I've been missing doing work on my personal projects so I'm going to try to start doing more of that.  To try to encourage myself, I'm going to try to start blogging more again.  I am not going to commit to blogging every week again, but I'll try to start posting updates again.

Over the coming while I hope to write about some of the things I want to be working on including:

 * (yet unnamed) hexapod!
 * [RepRap](http://reprap.org/)
 * [Maple](http://leaflabs.com/devices/maple/)
 * [Pololu Maestro](http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/1356)
 * A solar charger

Hopefully some of this will be interesting to read.
