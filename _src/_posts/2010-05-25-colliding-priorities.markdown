My plan for the [Victoria Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Day) long weekend was to spend most of it:

 * working on [Bob](/bob)
 * doing stuff with my kids
 * relaxing

What I didn't count on was that my wife planned for me to work on installing a new laminate floor in our family room over the weekend.
When it comes to a conflict between my plans and my wife's plans, usually my plans need to change.

While we were working my wife told me "We should \[renovate and\] flip houses.  We make a good team.  I can paint, and you can do everything else."

As such, instead of working on Bob, I spent most of the weekend doing such things as:

 * tearing out our old carpet and underlay
 * taking the old carpet and underlay to the dump
 * redoing some poor wiring on the TV cables in the wall/floor
 * chiseling out the bottom of the fireplace mantel
 * chiseling out the bottom of the door frame
 * getting started putting in the new laminate floor
 * taking everything off the wall so it can be painted
 * putting everything back on the wall
 * mowing the grass

On top of that, I found out on Saturday that there was a meeting I'd need to attend Monday at work.  That ended up taking most of the afternoon and evening on Monday.  So, no update on Bob this week, but hopefully I'll be done with the flooring soon and maybe then I'll get some work done on Bob again.  No promises though.

[Howie](http://howiewu.com) tells me I should stop being so handy.  Then I'd have more time to work on fun stuff.  The fact that there's a lot I can do combined with the fact that I'm too cheap to hire anyone to do something I can do sure does seem to lead to me doing more work.  I think Howie's on to something there.
