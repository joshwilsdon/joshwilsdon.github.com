Happy Canada Day!

I hope everyone is enjoying doing Canadian things like eating [poutine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine), playing hockey, watching or listening to the [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/) and going to [Tim Hortons](http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/index.html).

This post is my 26th this year.  That means we're now exactly halfway through the [project 52 challenge,](/2010/01/04/first-post) so I figured it's about time to post an update on the progress so far.  It's been tough some weeks to come up with either ideas or time to write something, but I've found a way to get it done.

In case you haven't checked the [scoreboard](/scoreboard) recently, the current status at the time of this post going live (Howie and Kevin still have a few more hours to make a post this week) is:

<div class="scoreboard">
<table>    <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <th><a href="http://yinkei.com">Kevin</a></th>
        <th><a href="http://howiewu.com">Howie</a></th>
        <th><a href="/">Josh</a></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Pass</td>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>14</td>
        <td>26</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Fail</td>
        <td>16</td>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Weeks</td>
        <td>26</td>
        <td>26</td>
        <td>26</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>% Pass</td>
        <td>38%</td>
        <td>54%</td>
        <td>100%</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</div>

As you can see, after challenging Howie and I to do this, Kevin's the one who has failed the most.

The only people who have failed more than Kevin are the [Project 52](http://project52.info) team themselves.  They've even posted a semi-apology on their site to people who have actually been keeping up with the challenge since January 1.  Since then (that post was March 18th) they haven't posted anything on their site.  I find that amusing.

Despite the fact that I have pretty much guaranteed myself a winning position, I'm still planning to post every week for the rest of the year.  It seems like a good challenge, so I'll try to push myself to keep it up.  Even if I have to stretch some weeks to come up with topics.  Who knows?  Maybe after the 52 weeks are up, I'll keep going.
