Unlike last winter when there was [a reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Winter_Olympics) to want lots of snow and [instead it was warm](http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2010/01/13/bc-cypress-mountain-closed-vancouver.html), it looks like [this year will be a great one](http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Brace+cold+snowy+winter+weather+forecaster+warns/3566587/story.html) for skiers around Vancouver.  For those who don't like the cold, blame [La Niña](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni%C3%B1a).

La Niña is the opposite of the famous [El Niño](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o) which we had last year during the Olympics.  With La Niña the temperatures are colder and there is a lot more precipitation (aka. snow).  It has already been colder than -10°C here which [is colder than normal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Vancouver).  Last night and into today it snowed quite a bit, but with snow came warmer weather and by afternoon it turned to rain.

Some miscellaneous thing's I've learned so far this winter:

* Your furnace won't heat your house if the hot surface ignitor is burnt out
* Getting someone to come fix your hot surface ignitor is expensive
* It's great to have a neighbor who drives a snow plow
* It's hard to take good pictures of snow with bad light and an iPhone4 camera
* Snow breaks everything, including the Internet
* None of the "Global Warming" protesters are out when the temperatures is -5°C
* When it's really cold outside most bums aren't out on the street asking for money (they're probably at home watching their plasma TVs)

Anyway, it seems like we've at least passed the biting cold for now and are back into the normal sog.  For a while there it was really starting to feel like we were in Canada!
