After [my last post](/2010/12/16/once-again-on-the-train) I got some feedback from one of my readers.  Note that's plural, I now have confirmed more than one person is reading this blog.  The comment I received was basically suggesting that instead taking the bus, I should ride a bike.  I was pointed to [this page listing 60 benefits of cycling](http://www.ibike.org/encouragement/benefits.htm).  I actually did try this for a few weeks before back when I was also working in Surrey.  Unfortunately I am too much of a wuss to keep it up.  Flat tires every week and several close calls with cars (there aren't bike lanes most of the way I need to go) already made it frustrating.  When I finally got hit by a car and had to deal with the police over a driver who took off after hitting me, I gave up on it.  Just too dangerous thanks to [people driving cars](/2010/02/02/the-problem-with-cars-is-people).  Maybe I'm a wuss, but I'd rather walk...  And I did for more than 2 years until I started working much further away.

Anyway, what I was actually going to write about here is the possibility of adding comments to this blog so that people can comment and I can respond.  I tried to add comments before using [intensedebate.com](http://intensedebate.com) but found that it slowed down the load of the page far too much.  Another thing I'm really worried about is the fact that I see so many blogs out there with comments full of spam, and on top of that I'll feel an obligation to respond to legitimate comments.  That is going to take even more time and blogging every week is already somewhat taxing when I'm really busy.  I discussed this with (I assume) my most loyal reader and the offer was made to help cultivate the comments, but I'm not sure he has time to do that either.

An even more important question, I think, is whether I'd continue blogging or not.  Because if I'm not going to continue blogging regularly comments are probably less important. So am I going to keep blogging?  I don't know yet.  I'm still thinking about it.  Maybe I'll come up with an answer for next week.  Next week will also be post #52 this year!  Which means I will have completed the [goal I set out at the beginning of the year](/2010/01/04/first-post).
