In [my last robot post](/2010/09/16/next-robot), I talked a bit about my next robot and asked for ideas.  Nobody sent me any ideas and it's been almost 2 months!  I guess that means either:

 * Nobody has better ideas than me
 * My burgeoning robot army scares people
 * Nobody reads this blog

whatever the case may be, I'm just going to have to continue this project without further outside input.

This past week one of my coworkers had a remote controlled helicopter in the office and that reminded me that I really need to get back to work on something.  A helicopter is tempting, but we'll see.  For now, what I've decided to do is just order some servos and a servo controller from Pololu.  This will allow me to get started on some prototyping.  I am also going to be ordering some more sensors and a new microcontroller board, but I haven't decided which ones to order yet.  I'll probably spend some more time deciding that after writing this post.

The two most time consuming tasks by far while building [Bob](/bob) were:

 1. building the mechanical components (ie. frame)
 2. soldering together the enormous tangle of wires + components
 3. dealing with the fact that I didn't have enough pins

This time I'm hoping to improve on that a little by:

 * doing less complicated work on the frame (and not using a hacksaw and hand file)
 * etching some boards instead of green-wiring
 * using a more powerful controller so I can write more software and fight less with hardware

Basically I'm going to try where possible to work smarter instead of harder.  I'll see how that goes.  I imagine I'll get a little better with each robot I build and won't really be considered good at it for quite a while.

Anyway, that's my quick update.  Hopefully I can make another update soon with some pictures of my parts and maybe even some more ideas based on initial prototyping.
