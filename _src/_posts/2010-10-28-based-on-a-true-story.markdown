Note: this is based on a true story insofar as I did come home from work today. Actually I came home from work twice today, but that's a different story.

Anyway, I was walking to the [skytrain](http://www.skytrain.info/) from my office (not that far at all) and I saw something weird out of the corner of my eye. The ground suddenly looked warped as though I were looking through some sort of lens, then just as quickly went back to normal.  Unsure if I had actually seen something or whether I was just hallucinating due to lack of sleep, I ignored it and continued on my way.

As usual the train that comes 33% of the time - the only one I can take - was the first to arrive at the platform.  It gorged itself on the crowd of people who could actually take it somewhere and disappeared down the tunnel. Strangely though the sound suddenly cut off as it rounded the corner out of sight. It didn't get quieter gradually, the sound just suddenly disappeared.  I looked around at my fellow platform waiters and nobody else seemed to have noticed that anything was amiss.  So, I stood there waiting and minded my own business.

Finally my train arrived and I scrambled on quickly, trying to get a seat, preferably one where my knees didn't touch the seat in front of me. I won that race and got a seat but then noticed that nobody else was getting on the train. In fact it didn't seem like there was anybody on the train at all.

"That's awfully weird" I thought.  I don't think I've ever been on the train so empty, even at 1:00 in the morning there are always **some** other people on the train. Why would I be the only one? And what happened to all the other people who were waiting on the platform? Did I somehow get on the wrong train? Was somebody playing some sort of practical joke on me?

Starting to get concerned, I stood up and began walking back down the train to see if maybe there was anybody at all on the train. Surely I couldn't be the only one! The doors had closed and the train was cruising right along at this point. It was also at this point I noticed something else that was strange. The tunnel walls outside the train windows seemed to be a single unbroken piece of concrete. There were no seams and not much at all for my eyes to focus on. And the train was moving fast. Faster than I remember it going and we should definitely have made it to the next station by now.

What could I do? Had they really managed to change the track and the route all while I was at work? Was I really just asleep and having a dream? Nothing seemed to make sense. Especially when combined with the ground going wavy and the disappearance of the previous train.

So I sat down in a seat to consider my options.

How long had I been on the train now? It must be at least 2 minutes. I took out my phone and started a timer. I was watching the numbers totally confused. The seconds were not the same length! The numbers were incrementing, 12..13.....14..15...16. How is that possible? I tried counting in my head. "one one-thousand, two one-thousand, three one-thousand"... I counted to 5 before one second passed on the timer. The next second I only counted to 2. I was definitely counting a constant speed. Or at least more constant than that.

This was no good at all.

It was at this time I noticed that the train seemed to be going even faster now, but the tunnel walls looked exactly the same. Then the lights in the train went off.

There was still light coming in from the tunnel lights outside the train, but my eyes were not yet adjusted and I couldn't see much.

That was when I finally started to panic.

I pressed on the yellow emergency button, thinking that it was worth a try.  Rather than (or possibly along with, I'll never know) triggering the silent alarm it gave me a painful electric shock.  It was at this point when I knew I was in trouble.

to be continued... (maybe)
