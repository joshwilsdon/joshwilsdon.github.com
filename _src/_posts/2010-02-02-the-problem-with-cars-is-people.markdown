I dislike cars.  Actually, it would probably be more accurate to say that I dislike most personal transportation that is human-controlled but not human-powered.  This mostly means I don't like cars, vans, trucks, taxis, etc.  But here I'll lump them all together as 'cars'.

I own a car and even drive, but when possible I avoid cars.  When I can't avoid being in a car, I try to avoid driving.  If it's the only viable way to get somewhere, I'll drive but I'd much prefer taking a train or walking when it's reasonable to do so.  If it were possible I'd gladly give up my car and rely entirely on non-powered transportation.  Unfortunately, in the time and place I currently live, not having a car is a difficult option to justify.

The reasons I don't like cars are manifold but they include (random generalizations):

 * cars are loud
 * cars are expensive
 * gas is expensive
 * cars stink up the environment
 * cars run on oil which is difficult politically and environmentally to obtain
 * [people driving cars are dangerous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Traffic_related_deaths_-_Road_fatalities_per_capita.svg)
 * [people think they're better at driving than they are](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority#Driving_ability)
 * cars are slow (compared to eg. [Shinkansen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinkansen))
 * driving requires concentration (which I'd like to use for other things)

The largest of these problems revolve around people (myself included).  If I were the only person on the road and I didn't need to worry about other cars or the drunk guy stumbling across the street, I might even enjoy driving.  I could drive much faster while paying less attention.  I'd never get stuck in traffic or at a red light.  Unfortunately, in the real world there are lots of other people and vehicles sharing space with cars.

Once again robots could save the day!  Imagine even a personal transportation option that looked exactly like your car but travelled much faster and was able to get you somewhere while you read a book.  You'd just get in and tell it where you want to go and it'd take you there as fast as possible while you enjoy your novel.  [People are even working on this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driverless_car), but it seems to me that they're not expending as much money or effort on that as people are spending on [protecting the ability to drive cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War).

Even if the technology were perfect though, the bigger problems that need to be overcome before I can stop driving for good are again people problems.  The unsolved problems include:

 * Getting people to trust computer control.
 * Building proper failsafes.
 * If a computer-controlled car **does** crash, who do I sue?!
 * Everyone needs to adopt it before it can really work optimally.
 * Where would highway patrol get all their revenue without speeding tickets?
 * Some people think their "freedom to be in control" is more important than other people's safety.

So... I guess I'll need to have a car for a while longer.

**UPDATE1:** [Research shows every hour you drive shortens your life by 20 minutes.](http://www.vancouversun.com/health/Driving+shorten+life/2517346/story.html)
**UPDATE2:** That doesn't mean you gain 40 minutes.  Driving 60 minutes, you waste 80!
