As [mentioned two weeks ago](/2010/11/04/more-robots) I've been tempted to get a helicopter recently.  Since I was a kid I've wanted a remote controlled helicopter.  Last weekend I finally got one!

We made a trip down to Bellingham WA, to do some shopping.  Shopping's not really my thing, but I suppose it was worth going because Costco had [this helicopter](http://www.interactivetoy.com/Manuals/Interceptor_RC_Manual_ENG.pdf) on sale for $34 which seemed like a pretty good deal.  I saw a few other helicopters that day at the mall, but they were either quite a bit smaller or quite a bit more expensive, or both.  At the time I thought I wanted one a bit bigger, but I didn't really have a plan to buy anything.  When I found a bigger one for only $34 though, it seemed like too good a deal to pass up.

When I was a kid, there were no cheap remote control helicopters.  I looked at hobby catalogues but they were all way outside what my allowance could afford.  It's amazing to see the difference in toy technology from then to today.  My uninformed hypothesis was that the reason I can now buy a working helicopter for $34 is a combination of several things:

 * shrinking electronics (both price and physical dimensions)
 * improved battery technology
 * cheap manufacturing in China

As usual, [wikipedia has the answer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_Helicopter).  And I was partially correct.  The piece I missed was about the [coaxial rotors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_rotors).  These make helicopters much simpler, more stable and easier to fly.  This however comes at a cost of forward speed.

Even if it's a bit slow, this helicopter is really fun to fly.  It seems to be fairly sturdy too and has survived some pretty hard crashes already.

Things I like about it:

 * cheap
 * relatively easy to control
 * charges via USB (takes ~20 mins to charge)
 * uses radio instead of infrared like some others I've seen

Things I'm less happy about:

 * battery life (lasts less than 4 minutes typically)
 * slower than I would have naively expected
 * too light to handle much wind

I think if I get another helicopter, I'd definitely consider getting one more advanced like perhaps [one of these](http://www.bladehelis.com/).

That said, one of the reasons I wanted to get a cheaper one was the possibility of hacking it.  I did some tests and this one could lift a bit more weight, though I imagine I'd have to be pretty careful to keep it balanced.  One of the things I considered was even trying to add an [Ardweeny](http://www.solarbotics.com/products/kardw/) and a few more sensors and have it fly itself around.  Maybe someday.
