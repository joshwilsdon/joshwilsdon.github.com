The [Honey Badger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_Badger) is one of the worlds toughest creatures.

Contrary to what you'd expect from their name, honey badgers are not actually badgers.  While badgers are pretty tough animals, they are not nearly as tough as honey badgers.  For an example of just how tough the fearless a honey badger is, see this video:

especially the parts where the honey badger climbs a tree just to attack a [Cobra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra) and when the honey badger takes the food a [Puff Ader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitis_arietans) is eating, eats it in front of him and then goes after the puff ader itself.  Being poisoned by one of the worlds most venomous vipers, he needs a nap.  After his nap, he finishes eating the puff ader and goes on looking for some more trouble.

Long story short: If you're in Africa, watch out for Honey Badgers!
