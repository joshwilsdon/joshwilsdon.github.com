This is my 41st blog post!

Both [Howie](http://howiewu.com) and [Kevin](http://yinkei.com) are doing beyond pathetically (each have 1 post in the past 15 weeks) in the [Project 52](http://project52.info/) challenge.  Not that the Project 52 people aren't [doing even worse](http://127.0.0.1:4000/2010/07/01/happy-canada-day/).  But, just because everyone else fails, doesn't mean I should quit.  That's not my style.

I do appreciate Kevin [challenging me](/scoreboard) though since that got me started writing which hopefully will someday allow me to get better at it.  Or encourage me to do something interesting, so I can blog about it.  Thanks Kevin!

It does mean however that when I've been really busy at work, you'll get a lame post like this.  Just a disjointed set of updates.  Sorry.  I'm glad you're reading this anyway though.  Thanks loyal readers!

I did update my [book list](/books) again since I finished the "The Other Lands".  It was really good, but now I'm stuck with the same problem [I wrote about last week](/2010/10/07/commonwealth-universe/) where I'm 2 books into a trilogy where I can't read the 3rd book for a while.  I blame my brother for getting me the first book for Christmas last year.  Thanks Jon!  Anyway, I just realized I finished 17 novels so far in 2010.  I should be able to make it to at least 20 for the year.  Thanks really long commute!

Um....

This past weekend I took my wonderful wife to Las Vegas for our anniversary.  Thanks Kaz for putting up with me this long!  We had a good time going to see "[O](http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/o/default.aspx)" and generally taking in some of the many things there are to do in Vegas.  While we were we went to one of the famous Vegas buffets.  The best part of a buffet is that you can have a plate of bacon covered in cheese if you want.  Thanks bacon for being so tasty!

If I sound pretty thankful this week, it's probably because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(Canada)">it was Thanksgiving</a> this week and I have a lot for which to be thankful.

So anyway, seems like I'm running out of time before the deadline for this post to count for this week.  Hopefully next week's post will be somewhat more coherent.  Maybe it will even include [the answer to life the universe and everything](http://www.google.com/search?q=the+answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything&btnG=Search).
