So it turns out I didn't do anything interesting since [last week](/2010/12/01/running-out) but [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/) did!

I've been pretty excited about SpaceX for a couple years since I first heard about them.  If you're not aware, they're a private space company started by [Elon Musk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) in 2002.  They are focused on creating low-cost commercial space launch vehicles and have created their launch vehicles with their very own design and manufacturing teams.

Anyway, the point of this post is that they just successfully became the first company to launch their own rockets, orbit the earth for a while at over 17,000 mph and land on target in the Pacific Ocean.  A pretty amazing feat and something I'm pretty happy to see.

Even more awesome is that their test payload was...  [a wheel of cheese](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101209/ap_on_sc/us_sci_test_rocket_secret_payload)! I wish they were a public company so I could invest my money with them.  I would have done so a couple years ago too, but now I imagine they don't need my money any more since they've got some pretty good contracts from NASA.

I am very hopeful that not only will SpaceX be successful, but that they will encourage some competition.  Maybe we can have a new [space race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Race) but this time with companies competing to do the most ambitious space-related stuff.

I think whichever company is the first to establish a permanent factory/research facility in earth orbit will very quickly be able to make the owner(s) very rich indeed.  Pulling metals and other good stuff from asteroids in orbit and manufacturing things that take advantage of the lack of gravity and atmosphere should allow someone to create all sorts of cool stuff to sell back to the earthlings.  I think it would also open up all sorts of other opportunities that haven't even been thought up yet.  I don't know if SpaceX wants to be the company to do this or if they just want to facilitate it, but either way I'm pretty happy to see it happening.

Congratulations SpaceX on your success, and I hope you have lots more to come!
