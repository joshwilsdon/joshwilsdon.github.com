For the past year and a bit I've been working with an awesome team on awesome stuff at [Layerboom](http://layerboom.com).  It's been a lot of work but I'm proud of what we managed to build, and proud of our team.  Apparently I'm not the only one who thinks both our team and the stuff we've made is awesome because [Joyent decided to buy Layerboom](http://www.joyent.com/2010/07/joyent-acquires-layerboom-systems). This means I'm officially a "[Joyeur](http://joyeur.com)" now.  We have joined the [Joyent](http://joyent.com) team and will continue to build awesome stuff.

The people I've met from Joyent so far are also awesome.  That means that surely the stuff we'll produce together will be extremely awesome.  You might think I'm exaggerating.  I mean, how many times can I use the word awesome in a post?  In reality though, it's pretty amazing.  I'm really excited about what we will be able to build along side and on top of what both companies have already built.  Keep watching, I'll be awesome.

I can't really go into any more detail than what's already been stated elsewhere, so this post will be shorter than usual.  This is exciting enough though, that I couldn't not write about it!
