I finally went to the dentist on Monday after not going for about a year and a half.  I hadn't gone for so long because I didn't have coverage for a while and didn't want to pay and even now that I've got coverage again, I've been really busy.  Not that it's really hard to come up with excuses not to go to the dentist...

So anyway, I went to the dentist and did the usual routine where they took some x-rays, told me that I need to floss more and poked at my teeth and gums with their metal tools trying to get them to bleed.  Then they ground away at my teeth with their little tooth sander that seemed like it was probably going to slip loose at any moment and rip my teeth right out.  The sander also has the wonderful habit of leaving bits of its sand wedged between my teeth.  I survived the lecture, the poking and the sanding and thought I'd just have to deal with the fluoride and I'd be all set for the next 6 months.  Unfortunately, they had another surprise waiting for me.

When the dentist came in to look at my X-rays and poke around in my mouth he said something to the effect: "Oh, there's a cavity".  I thought "oh, great...  That means I have to come back."  Then he said "that one too", and I knew I was in trouble because he wasn't done yet.  In all, I apparently have 4 cavities.  Three of them are surrounding previous fillings, so I'm guessing whichever dentist did those fillings didn't seal in them up tight enough and those cavities escaped then invited a friend over to their party.

So tomorrow I get to go back to the dentist for a **1 hour and 40 minute** appointment where he's apparently going to fix me all up.  At least for now.

If you ask me, we're long overdue for some of the new technology like [this gel that regenerates teeth](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2010-06/new-nano-gel-regenerates-teeth-making-drilled-cavities-obsolete) or [this plasma tooth cleaner](http://www.popsci.com/gear-amp-gadgets/article/2009-06/miniature-plasma-blowtorch-kills-plague-cleans-teeth) or even [these tooth seeds](http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2009-08/scientists-create-new-mouse-tooth-stem-cells).  But I'm pretty sure the dentist union is working hard to ensure these are not available anytime soon.

Oh, well.  If I survive I'll write a new post next week!
