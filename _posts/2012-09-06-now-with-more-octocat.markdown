The machine that this blog was hosted on is being retired and it was time for [yet another move](/2010/08/18/moving-again).  Instead of setting up another VM somewhere, installing nginx and git and keys and all the other stuff that I've done many times now, I decided to do the even more cloudy thing and move to [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).  This seems like a good choice as I've been quite happy with everything else github has to offer.  Plus it's free!

Since I was already using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), it wasn't a huge leap, but I made a few other changes at the same time which required some additional work that I didn't initially anticipate doing.  It seems like these will help me in the log run to diagnose / avoid problems.  Specifically:

 * switched to markdown from textile (converted all old content)
 * had to disable custom extensions and come up with alternatives
 * installed the latest version of jekyll (0.11.2) locally for testing (I was on on 0.5.7 before)

Since I had to convert a lot of the posts and do previewing to ensure the formatting matched the old site after the conversion, I noticed a few things about the content here.

It's interesting that to this point I've made 60 posts (including this one), 52 of which were in 2010.  My record since then is pretty bad.  I also noticed a few things that I said I'd follow up on but have not yet.  I'm not going to make any promises that I'm going to start blogging regularly again, but I do think that while I was trying to blog about my various projects I managed to make more time for the projects too.  So perhaps I should use this as a motivator for me to work on stuff.  We'll see how that goes.

If you're seeing this post at all, you're seeing it being served from Github.  I didn't push this post to the old server.
