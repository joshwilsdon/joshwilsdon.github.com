I've been spending more time learning Solaris, and I've been using OS X as my primary interface to the world of bits for about a year and a half.  For some reason though my thoughts recently went to Linux.  I'm still using Linux lots of places.  It is installed on my HTPC machine hooked up behind my TV, and in several servers both at work and out on the Internet.  I also realized that I've now been using Linux for over 15 years, so I figured that it deserved a blog post.

Thinking about my history with Linux reminded me that I still have the first set of Linux CDs I bought.  The CDs themselves are from December 1994, but I got them sometime in early 1995.  These CD's include such gems as Linux Kernel 1.1.72, Slackware 2.1, SLS 1.06 and Debian 0.91 Beta.  Along with DOOM and a complete archive of several of the main Linux sites.  Today, I made a backup copy of these CDs so that I can create a VM running old versions of Linux when I'm feeling nostalgic.  Anyway, here's a scan of the back of the CD set case:

Looking through the 30 page guide that came with it is pretty interesting.  The minimum setup is listed as 386SX with 4MB of RAM and at least a 10MB hard drive.  Yes.  Megabytes!  The recommended system is 486 with 16MB of RAM and 80MB of hard disk.  It also supports Hercules, CGA, EGA, VGA and Super VGA video cards.  I remember that the first machine I installed it on had a CGA monitor and I thought it was awesome.  This was well before Google existed and even the web was pretty fresh.

Since my first Slackware install, I've managed to use Linux most of the time.  I have also tried out OpenBSD, NetBSD and FreeBSD at various times but eventually came back to Linux.  I used Linux as my main desktop through university even though Windows was getting popular.  I tried Windows 95 and I think probably 98, but I always came back to Linux because it seemed so much more powerful.  I'm pretty sure I was the only one at my university writing philosophy papers with Vim.  Since University I've been using it for work.  At my previous jobs I used Linux exclusively, though I gave up on Slackware many years ago now and have been using Debian/Ubuntu ever since.

Most recently, I've been using OS X instead of Linux as a desktop OS.  It's pretty familiar though since I can still pull up a command line and run the many of the tools I'm used to.  Plus I spend a lot of time working on machines remotely over SSH anyway.  The system I'm getting really unfamiliar with is Windows.  Since Windows keeps changing and I keep not using it, I'm becoming pretty much useless when I get put in front of a Windows machine.  The only things that I can use comfortably on Windows are [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/).

So that's my quick trip down memory lane.  I'm not sure if I'll still be using Linux as much in the future.  It could be I'll be using more Solaris, or possibly even something else UNIX-like.  I'm sure I'll keep using Linux somewhere though.
