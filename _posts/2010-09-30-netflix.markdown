Wow, it seems like it was just yesterday I was writing last week's [post about paradoxes](/2010/09/23/paradoxes), and already it's time to write a post again!  Time sure flies when you're busy having fun!  This week will be another short post, since nothing as exciting as getting stuck in the elevator happened again.

[Netflix](http://netflix.ca) is finally available in Canada!  I've been waiting for this for quite a while and was pretty excited to try it out.  In case you're not familiar with it, Netflix has a service in the US (since 1999) where you can subscribe with a monthly fee and they will send you DVDs in the mail.  You can keep the movies as long as you want and then mail them back in a prepaid envelope.  Once you mail the movies back, they'll send you the next one on your wishlist/queue.  They have a huge library of DVDs with more than [100,000 movies as of 2009](http://netflix.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&item=307).  More recently (since 2007) they have been offering streaming of movies over the Internet, though the selection of movies you can stream over the Internet is much smaller than their DVD collection.

Until last week Netflix was unavailable in Canada.  Last week I finally got an email from them that they were launching their service in Canada.  Finally I could try it out!

In Canada Netflix is not doing DVDs.  The only option is streaming videos over the Internet.  I believe the selection of movies available for streaming in Canada is also more limited than that available for streaming to the US, but I can't confirm since I don't have an account with the US version.

Right now they have a promotion where the first 30 days are free.  So you can sign up and start watching movies right now and not have to pay anything.  You can stream movies to your web browser, PS3, Wii, Xbox360, iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad.  You can also apparently watch Netflix movies on the new [Apple TV](http://www.apple.com/appletv/).  After the first 30 days, the service is $7.99 which doesn't seem too bad considering that you can watch unlimited movies from their collection.

The first thing I did when I signed up was search for a bunch of movies I like in order to see what sort of selection they had.  Most of the movies I searched for were not available, but they do have a lot of good movies.  One thing that Netflix seems to do really well is recommendations.  You can rate movies you've watched (even if they're not available) and Netflix uses that information to help find you movies they do have that they think you'd like.  After I rated some movies it seemed to do a pretty good job of coming up with other movies that actually do sound pretty interesting to me.  Apparently the more movies you rate, the better it gets too.

The biggest concern I had before trying it out was whether the quality would be very good.  It turns out that it is a lot better than most other Internet video.  While quality can depend a lot on available bandwidth, the couple movies I tried out were definitely watchable.  A couple of them were actually really good.

Since I've only been trying it out for a couple days so far, I can't say it's the best thing ever yet, but so far my experience has been pretty good.  And it's probably worth at least $7.99/month.  I recommend that you try it out if you haven't already!
