summary: Wherein I discuss the initial plan for this site.

So [Kevin](http://yinkei.com) challenged me to do this [Project 52](http://project52.info) thing where I have to write something on this site 52 times this year.  I guess I'll see how that works out.  I figure by starting with not much here, I can count some of my changes to this site toward the 52 updates if I write about them.

I started this site with [jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  This was Kevin's recommendation.  It seems pretty straight forward since it just generates plain files which suits me fine.  I guess over the next 52 weeks (if I make it) you'll get a chance to find something out about me.
