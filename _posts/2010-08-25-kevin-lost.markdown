If you're reading this, my blog has been successfully moved to a Joyent Smart Machine.  I mentioned this move was coming in my [post last week](/2010/08/18/moving-again.)

This, my first post exclusively on the new site, will be just a bunch of updates.

First: [Project 52](/2010/01/04/first-post).  If you've been following the [scoreboard](/scoreboard) carefully, you might have noticed something that happened recently.  It is no longer possible for either Howie or Kevin to out-blog me this year.  Even if this were my last post and they posted every week for the rest of the year, it wouldn't be enough.  They both lost!  Does that mean I'm going to give up?  Probably not.  That's not my style.

Second: [Joyent](http://joyent.com).  I just wanted to give an update now that I've been working at Joyent a couple months.  So far it has been awesome.  The people at Joyent are awesome and we're working on awesome stuff.  It looks like I'll be moving down the stack for the next little while and possibly even getting into some kernel development, so that's pretty cool.  I'm also learning a lot of stuff about Solaris/OpenSolaris.  It's an interesting time to be getting into Solaris given [what's been going on](http://joyeur.com/2010/08/16/oracle-and-opensolaris-a-kernel-of-truth/).

Third: Robots.  Stay tuned for some updates in the coming weeks about some plans for my next robot.  [Bob](/bob) needs some friends!

Fourth: Zombies.  I haven't seen any all week.  I did see a herd of mountain goats, but I'm pretty sure they weren't zombie mountain goats.

Finally: Elevators.  I haven't been [stuck in one](/2010/08/09/beware-of-the-middle-elevator) for 2 whole weeks!
