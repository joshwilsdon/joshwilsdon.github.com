Recently a subject that has come up in conversation a lot is jobs.  This is for a number of reasons.  One is the depressing [US unemployment](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-07/unemployment-in-u-s-may-rise-toward-10-on-feeble-growth.html) numbers, and a lot of people saying that [the real jobless rate is much higher](http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/careers/what-is-the-real-unemployment-rate/19556146/) than the official government rate.  Another thing that often brings the discussion to jobs is any discussion of computers and robots in the future.

On the first point, it's pretty clear that many of the jobs that have been lost in the recent economic downturn will [not be coming back](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/79-million-jobs-lost-many-cnnm-1248019835.html?x=0).  The auto industry, along with many other industries where people are doing a lot of manual labour seem to already be spending too much on labour if they want to compete globally.  Elsewhere, lower human wages and more automation allow companies to produce goods cheaper and when automation is involved, often with higher quality.  This leads handily into my next point.

Automation in the form of both computers and robots allows companies to run manufacturing and many service operations 24 hours a day, 7 days a week without variation in the quality of work.  Or sick days.  The technology that makes this possible is improving all the time and the costs are coming down.  As time passes, I think people are also getting more and more comfortable with the idea of dealing with machines instead of people.  Many people now use ATMs instead of talking to their bank teller, and shop online without talking to a human in the whole process.  This is something that would have been really hard for people to accept not that long ago.

In both of these cases, I don't see a clear path for those people displaced to ever get their old jobs back.  If car companies switch to robots to put the frames together for their cars, it's hard to imagine the people whose primary skill is welding car bodies together are all going to be able to get a new job welding car bodies.  Most of them are likely going to need to do something at least slightly different.  It's the people who are unable to learn new skills that are going to have the hardest time.

A whole other post can (and may sometime) be written about whether there will be enough jobs at all for these people, even if they are willing to re-train, but I'll leave that out of this discussion for now.  Instead I want to end this post with a bit of optimism.

Having kids, I am extra concerned about the state of the future job market.  I really hope that my kids will be able to have a fulfilling job through which they are also able to support themselves.  In thinking about this, my opinion on how best to train them for that future is to ensure that they're good learners.  If they are able to learn new things quickly and not get too attached to one way of doing things.

I think this is something that people who deal with computers are already used to.  That is because in the world of technology, things are always changing.  Computers today are enormously faster and can store way more data than computers even 5-10 years ago.  Programming for machines with many processors requires building things differently than when machines used to have only one processor.  Even 5 years ago, there weren't many people writing apps for cell phones, now there's a booming industry around that.  Not to mention the changes in the way many things are being done due to [the cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing).  My opinion is that people who are the best at working with computers are the people who are able to constantly adapt and are always willing to learn new things.  I think in the future this same property is going to spread to many other industries as well because they will be depending on technology and a global market that are both changing very rapidly.

So what is my recommendation for people who want to be employed in the future?  Get good at learning new skills!  People who are unable to, or won't adapt are the people who are going to have the hardest time finding jobs.
