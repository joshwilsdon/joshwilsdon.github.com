I could write here about how [Howie](http://www.howardwu.com) failed the [Project 52](http://project52.info/) challenge in week 2 after [Kevin](http://yinkei.com) failed in week 1 and just call that my post for this week.  But I think that all this meta discussion is starting to get redundant, so I'll spare you and write about my books instead.

One of the things I really like to do is read books.  Now that I'm taking public transit to work, I've got almost 2 full hours to read during my commute each day.  Combined with the other time I spend reading, this means I've been going through more books.  An hour or so ago I finished reading the 3rd and final book of Peter F. Hamilton's "Night's Dawn" trilogy (pretty good by the way, but ~4000 pages).  Then I started thinking that I should put up a list of books I've read.  There are a couple motivations for this.  I figure it will:

 * help me remember which books I've read
 * allow other people who are interested keep track of what I'm reading
 * allow people who want to buy/lend me books to know which ones I've already read
 * increase the amount of content on this site

In order to make it easy to keep this list up to date, I wanted to find a service I could use that would let me just select books I've read or am planning to read or want to get and it would sort things out for me.  When I looked, the 3 best options I could find seemed to be [reader2](http://reader2.com), [bookwormr](http://www.bookwormr.com) and [shelfari](http://www.shelfari.com).  I tried to look at these and none of them seem to work for me:

 * reader2 is currently not accepting new registrations (blaming spammers)
 * bookwormr doesn't seem to have an API that lets me pull out my data and integrate with this site
 * shelfari doesn't seem to have an API and seems a bit weird with their "virtual shelf" concept

Does anyone else have any recommendations?  If so email them to <josh@wilsdon.ca>.

Until I find a service that I like I've just created a [simple list page](/books) which includes the books I could remember reading recently.  I'll update it as I read or remember other books.  This new page has also been added to my new menu/sidebar.
