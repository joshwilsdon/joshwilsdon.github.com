My last few posts have been pretty lame.  I admit it.  I'm not happy about that fact, but it seems like I'm going to continue being busy at work for a while.  I'm also having trouble coming up with ideas for posts.  In fact, I even resorted to looking at [random wikipedia articles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random) (click a few times and you might end up with great stuff such as [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telkwa_railway_station) or [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ullrich_Haupt)\) hoping for some inspiration.  That hasn't given me any major inspiration yet either.

Speaking of randomness...  I ran across a project this week that is offering [random numbers as a service](http://qrng.physik.hu-berlin.de/).  I thought that's pretty cool.

Anyway, If you've been following [the scoreboard](/scoreboard) you'll have noticed that after this post, I've got 4 more to do in order to have posted something here every week for a whole year.  That seems pretty amazing to me.  Especially considering how thoroughly everyone else seems to have failed.  Given how hard it has been to figure out what to write about some weeks, I'm not sure if I'll continue the weekly posting schedule in 2011.  I guess that partially depends on feedback I get from my reader.

In order to try to come up with some ideas for what I should consider writing about if I do continue past Jan 1, I have been trying to look at [the archive](/archive) to see which posts stood out as having sucked less than the others.  My thinking was to find what worked and try to do more of that.  It seems to me like posts that worked better were:

 * posts about stuff I was working on (esp. [Bob](/bob))
 * posts that were written while bad things were happening to me (eg. [Beware of the middle elevator!](2010/08/09/beware-of-the-middle-elevator))
 * posts about other things that I've done (eg. [Hiding out in Japan](/2010/08/04/hiding-out-in-japan)) 

posts that didn't work as well include: [most of the others](/archive).

What this tells me is that trying to force a post when I don't have anything really interesting to write about seems to end up not turning out well.  I guess that means I'm not that great of a writer.  Maybe that's a good reason to keep at it.  Or maybe it just means I need to do more stuff that's interesting to write about.  In the meantime, along with my ideas and the year, this post is also running out.  More next week!
