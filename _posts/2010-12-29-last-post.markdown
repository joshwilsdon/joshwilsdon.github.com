I've been away for part of the holidays and haven't had much time to write anything up.  I've also not spent much time deciding whether I'm going to keep blogging next year.  I did take a quick look at the [Project 52](http://project52.info) site and noticed they're going to try again this year.  That's not going to make much difference in my decision making process because I don't really believe they'll make it very far this year, since they failed so fast last year.

I did want to thank those readers who have been reading my blog this year.  If I'm going to continue posting, I'll make it a goal to set it up so you can comment on my posts early next year.

Blogging every week has been pretty hard.  I do think I've learned more about what makes for an interesting post (yeah, this isn't it) but those require even more work.  I'm going to try to make more of the interesting sort next year and fewer of these lame meta posts.  I could also decide not to post some weeks if it's only going to be a lame post, because maybe it's better to not post than to post something lame.

Either way, check out [the scoreboard](/scoreboard) and see how thoroughly Howie and Kevin failed.  It's pretty impressive.  Kevin hasn't posted since July!

Anyway, Happy new year!  I guess you'll find out next week if I'm going to keep posting!
